## Introduction

The aim of this project is to make the IITR Junta aware of all the resources available to them in a very user-friendly manner using a chatbot ( I call it “YourBuddy”). This project will help each student of IITR by helping them decide on their career through ML-based recommendations, connecting them with alumni of IITR in the respective field of interest through an internal feed algorithm, personalized internship /hackathons recommendations, and many more functionalities. I have integrated this chatbot with a website and give Janta a smoothless experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot:** Engage in conversations with our chatbot.
- **Alumni Connect:** Connecting with alumni of interest through a filter of field (Software Development / ML).
- **Hackathon Connect:** Informing about the going on/upcoming/completed hackathons and internships.
